# Programming-Notes
These are notes I created after experimenting for so long without studying. My main language is C++, not just because I love it, but it's also incredibly useful for game development. It is low-level enough that it can be well-understood and transferable to other languages. But yeah, just keep in mind that these were all written in C++.

The topics present currently are:
1. **Algorithms** - for testing out different algorithms for problem-solving, traversals, sorting, etc.
2. **DataStructures** - for analyzing different data structures such as lists, trees, graphs, etc.
3. **DesignPatterns** - for mapping out different design patterns under creational, structural, and behavioral.
4. **Fundamentals** - fundamental programming topics that are present in any language, such as loops.
5. **ObjectOriented** - for all things classes and their four fundamental principles, such as abstraction.
