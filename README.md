# Programming-Notes
These are notes I created after experimenting for so long without studying. My main language is C++, not just because I love it, but because it's also incredibly useful for game development. It is low-level enough that it can be well-understood and transferable to other languages that you might be using. But yeah, just keep in mind that these are all written in C++.

As the project evolves, I might naturally favor towards the use-cases in game development, but if I love the system enough, I might keep it. I have this weird obsession with good, well-thought of, and organized systems of just about everything.

> *Note: This is PURELY for my own learning progress. I can't please everybody. If it helps you then that's great, but I sometimes create my own ideas/systems here. I'll at least make sure to document my thought process enough for others to understand.*

The topics present currently are:
1. **Fundamentals** - fundamental programming topics that are present in any language, such as loops. (EMPTY)
2. **Data-Structures** - for analyzing different data structures such as lists, trees, graphs, etc. (CURRENTLY WORKING)
3. **Algorithms** - for testing out different algorithms for problem-solving, traversals, sorting, etc. (EMPTY)
4. **OOP** - for all things classes and their four fundamental principles, such as abstraction. (EMPTY)
5. **Design-Patterns** - for mapping out different design patterns under creational, structural, and behavioral. (EMPTY)


As the project evolves, I might add more folders eventually :D
